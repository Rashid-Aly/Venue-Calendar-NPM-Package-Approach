**Subject**: Venue Calendar NPM Package - Technical Approach & Build Plan

Hi Peet,

Thank you for the opportunity to work on the venue calendar NPM package project! I've analyzed your requirements and created a comprehensive plan for building `@get-micdrop/venue-calendar`. Here's my step-by-step approach:

## Project Overview

I'll create a distributable NPM package that allows comedy clubs to embed their event calendar on their websites without using iframes. The package will automatically mount to `<div class="micdrop-calendar-container"></div>` elements and support List, Gallery, and Calendar view modes.

## My 8-Phase Build Process

### **Phase 1: Foundation (Day 1)**
- Set up NPM package structure with proper configuration
- Choose Svelte 4.x as the framework (lightweight, perfect for embeddable components)
- Configure Rollup build system for multiple output formats
- Establish GitHub repository for version control

**Why Svelte?** Smaller bundle size than React/Vue, no virtual DOM overhead, excellent performance for embeddable components.

### **Phase 2: Core Component (Days 2-3)**
- Build `VenueCalendar.svelte` with three view modes
- Implement API integration with your Micdrop API
- Add responsive design with mobile optimization
- Create error handling and loading states

### **Phase 3: Auto-mounting System (Day 4)**
- Develop DOM scanning for `.micdrop-calendar-container` elements
- Create configuration system using data attributes:
  - `data-venue-id`: Venue identifier
  - `data-view`: Display mode (List/Gallery/Calendar)
  - `data-api-url`: API base URL
- Add utility functions for manual mounting

### **Phase 4: Build System (Day 5)**
- Configure Rollup for multiple formats:
  - CommonJS (Node.js compatibility)
  - ES Modules (modern bundlers)
  - UMD (CDN/browser usage)
- Optimize bundle size with tree shaking and minification
- Target < 50KB (gzipped) for fast loading

### **Phase 5: API Integration (Day 6)**
- Connect to `{apiUrl}/api/venues/{venueId}/events`
- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Add caching for performance
- Handle network errors and invalid venues gracefully

### **Phase 6: Testing & QA (Day 7)**
- Cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Mobile testing with touch interactions
- Performance testing and optimization
- CDN loading verification

### **Phase 7: Documentation (Day 8 - Morning)**
- Comprehensive README with usage examples
- Interactive demo page showing all features
- Integration guides for React, WordPress, vanilla JS
- Troubleshooting guide and API reference

### **Phase 8: Deployment (Day 8 - Afternoon)**
- Publish to NPM as `@get-micdrop/venue-calendar`
- Set up CDN distribution via JSDelivr and Unpkg
- Create GitHub repository with full documentation
- Final testing and optimization

## ðŸ”§ Technical Architecture

### Component Structure
```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ VenueCalendar.svelte    # Main calendar component
â””â”€â”€ index.js               # Auto-mounting & export logic
```

### Key Features
- âœ… **Auto-mounting**: Detects `.micdrop-calendar-container` elements
- âœ… **Multiple Views**: List, Gallery, and Calendar modes
- âœ… **CDN Support**: Works with JSDelivr for WordPress users
- âœ… **No Dependencies**: Lightweight with minimal footprint
- âœ… **Cross-platform**: Works in React, Vue, vanilla JS, and more

## Usage Examples

### Simple HTML (WordPress/Squarespace)
```html
<div class="micdrop-calendar-container"
     data-venue-id="comedy-club-123"
     data-view="Gallery">
</div>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@get-micdrop/venue-calendar@1.0.0/dist/index.umd.js"></script>
```

### React Integration (as you requested)
```jsx
import VenueCalendar from "@get-micdrop/venue-calendar";

function App() {
  const [venueId, setVenueId] = useState("");
  const [view, setView] = useState("List");
  
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Your React controls */}
      <div class="calendar-container"></div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Expected Outcomes

### For Comedy Clubs
- **Easy Integration**: Simple HTML copy-paste
- **No Technical Knowledge**: Works out of the box
- **Customizable**: Multiple view modes and styling
- **Mobile-Friendly**: Great experience on all devices

### For Get Micdrop
- **Increased Reach**: More venues can embed calendars
- **Better UX**: No iframe limitations
- **Brand Control**: Consistent Micdrop branding
- **Analytics**: Better tracking capabilities

## Success Metrics

- **Bundle Size**: < 50KB (gzipped)
- **Load Time**: < 1 second
- **Browser Support**: Chrome 60+, Firefox 55+, Safari 12+, Edge 79+
- **Cross-platform**: Works on WordPress, Squarespace, custom sites

## Deliverables

1. **Complete NPM Package** with all build outputs
2. **Auto-mounting System** for easy integration
3. **Three View Modes** (List, Gallery, Calendar)
4. **Comprehensive Documentation** and examples
5. **Interactive Demo** for testing
6. **GitHub Repository** with full source code
7. **Build System** for development and production

## Timeline & Next Steps

**Total Timeline**: 8 days (1 week)

**Ready to start?** This approach ensures we build a production-ready package that meets all your requirements and provides exceptional value to comedy clubs.

The package will be lightweight, fast, and easy for venues to integrate - exactly what you need to expand your reach without iframe limitations.

Let me know if you'd like to proceed with this plan or if you have any questions about the technical approach!

Best regards,

Rashid Ali
